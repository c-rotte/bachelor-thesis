Today, log-structured merge trees (LSM-Trees) are de facto the default index structure for database storage engines that aim to improve performance when processing write-heavy workloads. While they are widely used in various key-value stores, their structure is not asymptotically optimal regarding minimizing costly IO operations.

This thesis instead focuses on the B$^\varepsilon$-Tree, an adaption of the typical B$^+$-Tree, which asymptotically offers the write performance of an LSM-Tree combined with the read performance of a B/B$^+$-Tree. We introduce a page-buffered B$^\varepsilon$-Tree design with the primary objective to increase scalability with multiple threads. We then evaluate our B$^\varepsilon$-Tree against a reference B$^+$-Tree implementation as well as LevelDB and RocksDB, two key-value stores built on top of an LSM-Tree. Our evaluation shows that our design can outperform all three comparative systems in some instances. Therefore, we believe that, with additional modifications and optimizations, B$^\varepsilon$-Trees can be used to optimize write operations while still performing reads with similar performance as typical database systems.
